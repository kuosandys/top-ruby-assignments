# Assignments from The Odin Project's Ruby Programming Course

1. Caesar Cipher (/caesar): A caesar cipher that works in the command line by asking users for a message to encode, a shift factor for encoding, and returns the encoded message. (Now with rspec tests.)

2. Substrings (substrings.rb): Asks the user for some text and checks if the text includes words from our dictionary. Returns to the user a list of all the words found in our dictionary and the number of times it occurs in the text.

3. Stock-Picker (stock_picker.rb): A stock picker that works in the command line. Enter a list of stock-prices and receive advice on which days to buy and sell for maximum profit.

5. Tic Tac Toe (/tic_tac_toe): A tic-tac-toe game to be played on the command line. (Now with rspec tests.)

6. Mastermind (mastermind.rb):
Option 1: The computer will randomly generate a 4-element code from the colours Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, and Pink. Your job is to try and guess the code before you run out of your 12 guesses.

Option 2: You can create a code of your own length of choosing from the colours Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, and Pink. The computer will try and guess the code within 12 rounds, and you must provide honest feedback for the computer's guesses using the key provided.

7. Hangman (hangman.rb, 5desk.txt): A game of hangman to be played on the command line - includes save feature.

8. Fibonacci (fibonacci.rb): Returns a specified number of numbers from the Fibonacci sequence - includes both looping and recursive methods

9. Merge Sort (mergesort.rb): Sorts an array of numbers using a recursive method and the merge sort method.

10. Linked Lists (linked_lists.rb): Creates a linked list object with Node object.

11. Binary Search Tree (bst_2): Creates a binary search tree, including functions such as insert, delete, rebalance, and different ways of traversing the tree.

12. Knight's Travail (knight.rb): Creates a knight on a chess board and calculates the fewest number of moves a knight needs to make to move from one square to another.

13. Connect Four (/connect_four): A game of connect 4 to be played in the command line. Built with TDD (test-driven development) principals and includes rspec tests.
